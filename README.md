# Game Hub

This is a tutorial I followed to learn the fundamentals of React. Using this course, I was able to learn a solid foundation for React, including HTTP requests, states, modular building design principals, and code efficiencies.

## Next steps in my learnings

I plan to keep learning more about React, and to further my front end development knowledge.
